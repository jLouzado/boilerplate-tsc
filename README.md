# Typescript-Monorepo Boilerplate

Template for typescript mono-repos

## Available

First package, with the following:

- typescript
- jest
- chai
- prettier
- tslint

## Setup

- Just make a new repo with this as a template
- rename the packages, (and the name in package.json) and you're good to go

## Automation Wishlist

- pre-commit hooks
- circleCI or travis integration
- graphql
- spellcheck
- publish package with: https://github.com/davidchambers/xyz
- assert aspects of architecture with: https://www.npmjs.com/package/dependency-cruiser
- remove the `quiet` of eslint once I figure out how to only give files not in eslintignore
