# Typescript-Monorepo Boilerplate

Template for typescript mono-repos

## Available

First package, with the following:

- typescript
- jest
- chai
- prettier
- tslint

## Setup

- Just make a new repo with this as a template
- rename the packages, (and the name in package.json) and you're good to go

## Automation Wishlist

- pre-commit hooks
- circleCI or travis integration
- graphql
- spellcheck
- publish package with [xyz](https://github.com/davidchambers/xyz)
- assert aspects of architecture with: [dependency-cruiser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dependency-cruiser)
- remove the `quiet` of eslint once I figure out how to filter out files in eslintignore so it [doesn't cry](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59549917/3121906)
